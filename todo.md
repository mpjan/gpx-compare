- [x] Make the elevation profile graph interactive
- [-] Smooth out the data before calculating the slope, because the data seem to have some noise
- [x] Do calculations based on Pandas DFs?
- [/] Encapsulate the code in a class to make it easier to use
    - Parei na parte dos mapas
- [ ] Add the slope classification to the interactive graph
- [ ] Add round km markers to the map
- [ ] Other metrics
    - [ ] Elevation gain / distance
    - [ ] Longest ascent (horizontal and vertical distance)
    - [ ] Longest descent (horizontal and vertical distance)
- [ ] Calculate overall difficulty metric
- [ ] Add a scatter plot with all routes, with distance vs elevation gain
- [ ] Add second route to the elevation profile graph
- [ ] Make Streamlit app
- [ ] Should I use an actual database, or is a CSV file enough?
- [ ] Link elevation profile cursor to the position of the cursor on the map
